CALCULATOR
t takes a little skill to create a calculator with basic mathematical functionalities using CSS, HTML, and JavaScript. Calculators require an interactive interface to perform basic functions such as addition, subtraction, division, and multiplication. It will need a  display screen to display the userâ€™s input and give the results. The grid system in CSS is for the alignments of buttons on the calculator. The additional tools you need to build a fully functional calculator include eventListeners, if-else statements, operators, loops, and so on. 

Explanation of the role of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in designing the calculator:

HTML (HyperText Markup Language): HTML provides the structural framework for the calculator. It defines the layout of the calculator elements such as buttons, display screen, and any other necessary components. HTML creates the backbone of the calculator by organizing its various parts into a coherent structure.

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets): CSS is responsible for the visual styling and presentation of the calculator. It allows for customization of the calculator's appearance, including colors, fonts, spacing, and overall design aesthetics. CSS ensures that the calculator not only functions well but also looks visually appealing and user-friendly.

JavaScript: JavaScript adds interactivity and functionality to the calculator. It enables dynamic behavior such as handling user input, performing arithmetic operations, updating the display screen with the result, and responding to user interactions like button clicks. JavaScript essentially brings the calculator to life, transforming it from a static layout into a fully functional tool for mathematical calculations.
